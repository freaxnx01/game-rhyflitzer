# Test TODO

Manual playtests still owed. Tick an item once it has been played in the browser (live: https://github.freaxnx01.ch/game-rhyflitzer/), and note what was found.

## Building heights (#17, PR #26 — merged 2026-10-02)

- [ ] **Winkel / Bodenackerstrasse quarter is recognizable:** J → Sisseln, then drive to the Hallenbad (Bodenackerstrasse 2). Check:
  - the Hallenbad sits where it should
  - Bodenackerstrasse 6 stands as the 8-storey block (about 27 m)
  - the apartment block next to it (OSM way `1326045746`, not in the 2020 survey) is a normal 12 m block, not a stub
  - the roundabout where you turn into the Ringstrasse
- [ ] **Low houses:** 28 of 123 measured houses in the quarter sit at the 2.5 m eaves floor (e.g. `171822811`: 2.5 m walls under a 5.6 m roof). Do they look plausible, or should the eaves push-down be capped? This decides whether #17 can be closed.
- [ ] Elsewhere on the Swiss side: do measured buildings look plausible (no towers out of nowhere, no sunken houses)?

## Random spot (#21, PR #27 — merged 2026-10-02)

- [ ] J → 0 (and a click on "Random spot") drops the car on a road somewhere on the map, a different spot each time, never on a bridge or motorway.
- [ ] During a race: a random spot marks the run "with a jump, not counted".
